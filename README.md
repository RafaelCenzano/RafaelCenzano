I'm a senior in highschool who enjoys coding as a hobby and plans to pursue it as a career. I have taken both AP CS courses and have been self-learning Python, HTML, CSS, and more for over 3 years.

##  Iâ€™m currently working on:
### Organizations
- :cloud: [Hack the Cloud](https://cloud.hackthefog.com), an [Hack the Fog's](https://www.hackthefog.com) **online hackathon** in response to the pandemic. (Co-Founder and Co-Director)

- :snake:Empower.py, an organization working to **teach cs through python**. (Director of Instruction)
- :bust_in_silhouette: [Japantown Youth Leaders](https://jcyc.org/jyl.htm), as a student leader I volunteer at events and create a service project every year resulting in over **100 volunteer hours** every school year.
### Projects
