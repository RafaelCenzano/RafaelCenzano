I'm a 3rd year CS major at RPI who enjoys coding as a hobby and plans to pursue it as a career. I have worked primarily with Python and Flask but through my 1+ year of internship experience, I have picked up Java, SQL, and related libraries as well as experience with cloud resources on AWS.

Distinguished service on a chapter level; that is, making an outstanding and unique contribution to the chapter as a whole. Exemplifying and furthering in demonstrable ways the principles of Leadership, Friendship, and Service. Making a sustained contribution in a leadership role over a period of time.

This society, Phalanx, became the fellowship of those most active in student activities.
